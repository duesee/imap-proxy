# IMAP Proxy

A proxy that receives, `Debug`-prints, and forwards IMAP messages.

It should™ forward all messages *without changing their semantics*. (See note below.)

Still, ...

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't use in production (yet)!**

## Features

Thanks to `imap-next`, the proxy ...

* takes advantage of asynchronous I/O,
* abstracts away literal handling, and
* fully supports unsolicited responses,

... making it easy to modify.

## Overview

```mermaid  
graph LR;
	Client -->|"① parse Command"| Proxy;
	Proxy  -->|"② change Command (currently no change)"| Proxy;

```

> [!NOTE]
> A few semantic changes are required to make the proxy more useful.
> These changes are communicated by the proxy, e.g., by emitting a warning or prefixing a `text` field.
>
> **Literal handling** IMAP allows sending commands "piece-by-piece" using literals.
> However, forwarding single pieces rules out modifications that change the size of a literal.
> Thus, the proxy collects all pieces first and presents single messages that can be easily replaced (if so desired).
>
> **Capability stripping** Capabilities can introduce fundamental protocol changes.
> Thus, forwarding unknown capabilities would mean we are willing to "lose track" of our session understanding.
> It also implies the proxy needs to forward unparsed messages and (somehow) "get on track" at some later point.
> Doing so requires an in-depth analysis of the problem and its implications.
> Thus, we prefer to strip unsupported capabilities and error out on parsing errors.

# Quickstart

Change into the `proxy` folder and run ...

```shell
cargo run -- --help
```

... for an overview of arguments.

**Important**: You must enable tracing (logging) to see a `Debug`-print of exchanged messages.

To do so, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.

Use ...

```sh
RUST_LOG=proxy=trace cargo run
```

... to start the proxy (using the default `config.toml`), enabling all log messages for the "proxy" module.

## Config

Have a look at the `config.toml` file for different scenarios.
The first scenario "Insecure to TLS" is useful for a (local) forwarding proxy and is already enabled.

Note that you can start multiple services using TOML's [array of tables](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables) syntax:

```toml
[[services]]
# ...

[[services]]
# ...
```

The `encryption` field configures transport encryption, i.e., `Insecure` or `Tls`.
`Insecure` disables TLS encryption and SHOULD NOT be used when proxying to a remote server.

# Creation of local TLS certificates

Please install (and use) [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to create a local certificate authority (CA).
The tool takes care to "register" the local CA with [typical trust stores](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#supported-root-stores) on your system.

We recommend creating a `private` folder in the `proxy` directory before creating certificates and keys.
The `private` folder is `.gitignore`d, so you can't accidentally push your keys.

```shell
mkdir private
cd private
```

With `mkcert`, you should now be able to create a certificate (+ key), e.g., ...

```shell
mkcert localhost
```

The command creates two files, `localhost.pem` (certificate) and `localhost-key.pem` (key). Now, edit your `config.toml` ...

```toml
[services.bind.identity]
type = "CertificateChainAndLeafKey"
certificate_chain_path = "private/localhost.pem"
leaf_key_path = "private/localhost-key.pem"
```

... accordingly, start the proxy, and test your connection with OpenSSL, e.g., ...

```shell
openssl s_client -verify_return_error -crlf -connect <host>:<port>
```

Note: `openssl s_client` should only really be used for testing.

# Supported authentication mechanisms

The proxy forwards authentication messages unchanged, and uses an [allow-list](https://github.com/duesee/imap-next/blob/0ccd9384d36ae5aecb15417aeedf772543d9a661/proxy/src/util.rs#L120C4-L120C31)
of capabilities and authentication mechanisms to exclude everything it doesn't understand.

Some authentication mechanisms "bind" to the TLS connection ("channel binding") and will fail when proxied.
These are not proxyable by design -- at least without further ado -- and are filtered from the connection.

| Authentication mechanism | Support                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| LOGIN                    | supported                              |
| PLAIN                    | supported                              |
| XOAUTH2                  | supported                              |
| SCRAM-*                  | supported                              |
| SCRAM-*-PLUS             | not supported (due to channel binding) |
| Others                   | not supported (yet)                    |

# Current purpose

Proxies are a great way to challenge the usability of a network library such as `imap-next`.
To implement a proxy, it's required to implement both the server- and client-side, and the tasks require designing the library in a way that allows even fine-grained forwarding.
Further, a usable proxy would significantly extend the exposure of `imap-codec` to real-world network traces.
It should be possible to permanently stick the proxy between real-world IMAP sessions, e.g., to track day-to-day email sessions (and ask other contributors to conduct the same test.)

# Future work

The proxy could enrich existing clients' functionality to improve compatibility, performance, and security.
This could be done by fleshing out the proxy into a configurable framework.

Examples:

* Support
  * `XOAUTH2` could transparently be added to non-supporting clients
* Security
    * Encryption could be transparently added such that emails are always appended in encrypted form and decrypted during fetching
* Support & Security
  * Vintage clients could use the proxy as a TLS/Compatibility gateway (See ["Using modern email on vintage clients"](https://julienblanchard.com/articles/modern-email-and-vintage-clients).)
* Performance
  * Support for "capabilities in greetings" or `LITERAL+` could be transparently added to improve performance
* Testing
  * Messages could be forwarded to other software for analysis
  * Protocol traces could be automatically analyzed for supported features
  * Proxy could inject non-semantic changes to expose interoperability issues (See issue #62.)
